# Student Registration System

This Ruby on Rails project is aimed at building a web application for managing student registrations. The system allows educational institutions or organizations to efficiently handle the registration process for students, providing a convenient platform for both administrators and students.

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> This project can and should be upgraded, as not all functionality is implemented, but rather it is a great template for future reference created by myself by using Turbo Frame and Turbo Stream technologies. Please note that some of the data is hardcoded.

2. Navigate to the correct directory (case-sensitive)

3. Run `bundle install`

4. Setup Database Configuration 

   - 1. Edit configuration manually

      - Open `config/database.yml`.

      - Find the environment section you're configuring (`development`, `test`, `production`).

      - Replace `username` and `password` with your PostgreSQL username and password.
